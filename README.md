## ☁️ AWS re/Start Program

As part of the AWS re/Start program with Praesignis, I am building a comprehensive foundation in cloud computing. The program covers:

- **Cloud Foundations:** In-depth understanding of core AWS services including EC2, S3, VPC, IAM, Lambda, and more.
- **Linux Essentials:** Command-line proficiency, scripting, and system administration.
- **Databases:** Relational and NoSQL databases on AWS (RDS, DynamoDB).
- **Networking:** VPC configuration, subnets, routing, security groups, and network ACLs.
- **Security:** Currently focused on cloud security best practices, shared responsibility model, and AWS security services.

The curriculum balances **theoretical knowledge** of all AWS services with **hands-on labs** that simulate real-world use cases, ensuring practical experience in deploying and managing cloud solutions. You can follow my cloud journey in my [AWS re/Start repository](link-to-repo).
